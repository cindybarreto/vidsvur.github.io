# Current research

There was a common theme to all the projects that I have done ever since my Master's. 
I had stumbled onto bioinformatics and genomics from my thesis days onwards. The complexity of plant-parasitic interactions is an interesting phenomenon, 
and understanding these interactions from an evolutionary perspective is what I wish to study during my PhD. 

I will be studying the interaction between the Eastern Hemlock and Hemlock Woolly adelgid.
